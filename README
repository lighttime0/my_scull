scull:
	Simple Character Utility for Loading Localities

Start scull:
	$ make
	$ sudo insmod scull.ko
	$ dmesg | tail -10
	
Now, you need to remember scull_major and scull_minor appeared, and run:
	$ sudo mknod scull c $(scull_major) $(scull_minor)

For example, you see "scull_major=245, scull_minor=0", you need to run:
	$ sudo mknod scull c 245 0

Then, you can test scull. Use "cat", "echo" .etc. For example:
	$ cat /dev/scull
	
	$ echo "Second string!" > /dev/scull
	$ cat /dev/scull


After run, you need to:
	$ sudo rm /dev/scull
	$ sudo rmmod scull
	$ make clean
